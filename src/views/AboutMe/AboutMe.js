        <p>
          My career goal is to gain a role which allows me to further my
          knowledge and skills, granting me new opportunities and broadening my
          horizon. I enjoy coding because I love the process of conceptualising
          new web applications that make life easier for people. I enjoy the
          challenge of problem solving, transforming data, using databases to
          manipulate and render data in a new way. I also enjoy the challenge of
          debugging and creating something from nothing.
